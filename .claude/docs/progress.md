## 2026-07-13 Asia Deli Go Mobile Hero Full-Frame Fix

- Asia Deli Go hero slides now reuse the complete 1920x600 campaign artwork on mobile instead of cropped 768x480 left-half derivatives.
- Hero blocks with a complete set of dedicated mobile artwork keep the taller 1.6:1 mobile layout; blocks without it preserve the desktop artwork at 3.2:1, avoiding crop and layout distortion.
- Removed the six obsolete cropped mobile WebP files and synchronized static plus admin draft/published config to `mobileImageUrl: null`.
- Verified with storefront/admin production builds, storefront config tests (3/3), admin unit tests (25/25), config audit, and browser QA at 320px, 390px, and 1440px across all six slides. Production promotion remains gated behind the normal deploy approval.

## 2026-06-10 Kenmito Landing Visual Direction Polish

- Landing page now moves closer to the approved JaponiaCentralna/NaSushi reference direction without adding dishonest commerce claims: first viewport remains Kenmito green/serif/pickup-led, but the page is denser and more transactional.
- Desktop and mobile homepage now surface the trust strip near the hero, with only supported claims: pickup/self-collection, manual confirmation, live catalog availability, wishlist saving, and repeat-order cart readiness. Mobile uses a horizontal trust rail so the fixed bottom nav does not bury the strip.
- Category discovery now includes compact popular-category chips and more intentional fallback category visuals instead of large initial-letter blocks that read like loading placeholders.
- Homepage product cards on desktop now expose quantity and add-to-cart actions immediately, matching the product-first behavior learned from JaponiaCentralna, while preserving Kenmito's multi-image hover preview.
- Header polish now keeps the Kenmito wordmark visible on mobile, adds a NaSushi-style desktop wishlist hover/focus popover, and groups the mobile drawer into wishlist/cart, account, and shopping navigation sections.
- Tests were updated to lock the new transactional card behavior instead of the previous hover-only homepage action model.
- Intentionally skipped for now: fake shipping countdowns, fake review widgets, fake free-delivery thresholds, and inactive newsletter/payment/contact claims until owner-backed data exists.

### Completion Follow-Up

- Added a pickup-first desktop landing regression test covering header brand/search/cart/wishlist, hero CTA/product imagery, trust strip, category chips/fallback visuals, footer service notes, and absence of `href="#"` footer links.
- Strengthened product-card wishlist states on desktop and mobile with `aria-pressed`, visible saved-state chips, and focused E2E coverage while preserving the existing hover image preview behavior.
- Reworked category fallback art so categories without configured images render an intentional package/category surface instead of letter-block placeholder grids.
- Footer fallback now avoids inactive `#` links and only shows service/contact/service-note claims backed by config or fulfillment mode.
- Verified: `npm run test:e2e -- tests/mobile-homepage.spec.ts --project=pixel-7`, `npm run test:e2e -- tests/product-card-scan-value.spec.ts tests/wishlist-accessibility.spec.ts`, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `git diff --check` (CRLF warnings only).

## 2026-06-09 Landing Product Card Hover And Density Fix

- Product card image preview layers no longer intercept wishlist clicks while cycling through multi-image media on hover/focus.
- Desktop product-card overlays now keep wishlist, freshness, and nutrition controls above decorative carousel layers with explicit stacking.
- Product card action rows no longer reserve bottom space for an invisible quantity unit label, bringing the bottom padding closer to NaSushi/JaponiaCentralna-style dense product cards.
- Product card primary images no longer scale beyond their no-crop container on hover, and carousel previews now provide an opaque backdrop so wide preview images do not expose the primary image underneath.
- Added Playwright regression coverage for wishlist hit-target ownership after hover, 44px wishlist control sizing, compact CTA bottom spacing, no-crop hover geometry, and carousel backdrop coverage.

## 2026-06-06 Kenmito Retail Polish And Checkout Readiness

- Product listing images now use a no-crop package policy and can display a secondary catalog image on desktop hover/focus when Zyra provides multiple `media` images.
- Product cards no longer repeat pickup, bank-transfer, and manual-confirmation operations chips on every item; those promises belong to page-level trust/checkout surfaces.
- Mobile product cards keep compact add/wishlist touch actions and reveal the full quantity stepper only after the product is in the cart.
- Product detail galleries now use contained package images, visible `1/n` counters, previous/next controls, and index-specific thumbnail labels while preserving the 320px overflow fix.
- Checkout now states the real launch blocker when backend returns no pickup/shipping or payment methods for the channel instead of implying a generic checkout handoff bug.
- Polish fulfillment copy touched by launch surfaces now uses correct diacritics.
- Backend audit from 2026-06-06 supersedes older notes that said Kamito had active `PICKUP` and `bank_transfer`: current production is browse-only and checkout remains NO-GO until backend links shipping/payment methods, maps warehouse if required, proves test orders, and wires staff order notification.

## 2026-06-06 Kenmito Catalog-First Homepage

- The legacy homepage hero now uses one responsive catalog-first visual system on mobile and desktop, with real product thumbnails from the existing product query and a clean no-media fallback.
- Availability-only storefronts now show visual real-category cards ordered by assortment size, configured commercial links, and a truthful pickup/bank-transfer/manual-confirmation trust strip.
- Generic homepage labels no longer claim category popularity or product recency without supporting data.
- Kenmito's hero copy now describes Asian pantry ingredients and pickup honestly; the image-less Korean pantry promo banner is disabled while its quick link and curated collection remain active.
- An explicitly empty or fully disabled `homepage.promoBanners` list now renders no carousel instead of falling back to generic promotional claims.
- Owner-approved logo, hero/category photography, contact details, and pickup/payment instructions remain open content work.

## 2026-06-06 Kenmito Display Brand And Promotion Cleanup

- The shopper-facing brand is now `Kenmito` in admin draft/published config and the tracked storefront static config; technical tenant/channel/slug/file identifiers remain `kamito`.
- The production canonical remains `https://kamito.enail.pro`.
- Kenmito Deals and Outlet surfaces are disabled because Zyra exposes no real sale data and the previous Outlet pointed at the regular Korean pantry collection.
- The shared homepage no longer fills a Deals shelf with regular products. A configured Deals section disappears after loading when the catalog has no discounted products.
- The Korean pantry collection remains enabled as an honest curated navigation surface.
- Misleading `Kontakt -> /privacy` and `Dostawa -> /terms` footer links were removed until real routes and owner content exist.
- Owner phone, email, address, prepared logo/favicon, pickup instructions, and bank-transfer instructions remain unresolved rather than being filled with guessed values.

## 2026-05-24 Kamito Launch Hardening Update

- Storefront `StorefrontConfig.general.fulfillment` is now synced across admin and storefront with delivery/backend/exact-stock defaults and Kamito pickup/bank-transfer/availability-only config.
- Header service strip, product detail, cart, checkout, and order confirmation now use generic fulfillment config so pickup tenants do not show false same-day shipping, free-shipping, exact-stock, or automated notification promises.
- `/categories` is now a grouped searchable category hub over real category links/counts; the homepage can show real category shortcuts plus commercial quick links instead of storage-zone cards when stock display is availability-only.
- `admin-panel/data/config-kamito.json` no longer tracks localhost media URLs; logo/favicon/image blocks are null/removed until owner assets are supplied.
- Added targeted Kamito config audit plumbing and launch Playwright coverage for pickup/bank-transfer truth, grouped categories, and mobile homepage category shortcuts.
- Backend follow-up confirmed Kamito uses shipping method id `PICKUP` and payment gateway `bank_transfer`; storefront launch tests now use that real pickup id and checkout shows a persistent error instead of redirecting when `checkoutComplete` returns `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK`.
- Storefront now supports explicit `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATIC_CONFIG_URL` fallback and tracks `public/config/kamito.json` so Kamito launch truth can load without a backend/admin config API and without touching shared backend or Chesaigon.

### Pages & Routes

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Homepage (`/`) | ✅ | Mobile + desktop layouts, hero section, Shop by Zone, Deals, Fresh Picks, Recipes. Config-driven section ordering and banner blocks. Skeleton loading states. 2026-05-22: admin Hero Banner blocks now occupy the first hero slot instead of rendering below the hardcoded legacy hero; legacy hero copy/CTA also reads `homepage.hero` config. 2026-06-06: Deals now renders real discounted products only and disappears when the loaded catalog has no sale pricing; Kenmito disables this section until backend sale data exists. 2026-06-06: the legacy hero now uses real catalog media across breakpoints; availability-only stores get visual category discovery and truthful fulfillment trust, and unsupported popularity/recency labels were removed. |
| Products listing (`/products`) | ✅ | Search, sort, category/zone/allergen/dietary/certification/price filtering, pagination. Responsive grid. 2026-05-15: listing state/filter/grid behavior moved into shared `ProductListingClient`; `/products` remains the uncategorized catalog surface while category pages pass category context into the same controls. 2026-05-24: standalone `/products` now exposes category filter chips in the desktop filter panel and mobile draft/apply filter sheet, matching the reference stores' category-first catalog pattern. 2026-05-24: committed filters now render an active-filter summary with result count, removable chips, clear-all action, and localized empty-state recovery copy. 2026-05-25: product listing cards opt into a catalog scan hierarchy for price/unit price, promo, availability-only stock, category/origin/storage facts, and Kamito pickup/bank-transfer/manual confirmation truth without changing homepage card surfaces. |
| Categories (`/categories`, `/categories/[slug]`) | ✅ | 2026-05-13: added flat-first category browsing from Zyra GraphQL `categories(channel)` and nested `Category.products(channel, first)`. Keeps empty storefront categories visible with Coming soon/Wkrótce badges, shows per-category `totalCount`, and renders category slug product grids with load-more support. 2026-05-14: refactored to SSR-first/no-JS first render, added deterministic GraphQL SSR Playwright mock coverage, and updated current admin config nav/footer links to expose `/categories`. 2026-05-15: category slug pages now reuse product listing sort/filter/grid controls and query `products(filter: { categories: [id], ... })` when JS is enabled, while preserving SSR/no-JS first render. |
| Commercial collections (`/collections/[slug]`) | ✅ | 2026-05-23: added config-backed curated landing pages with hero, optional image, and ordered tiles from `StorefrontConfig.commercial.collections`. Disabled or missing collections return 404. |
| Outlet (`/outlet`) | ✅ | 2026-05-23: added config-backed Outlet route. 2026-06-06: Kenmito disables the route and removes its links because mapping Outlet to the regular Korean pantry collection was misleading without sale semantics. |
| Product detail (`/products/[id]`) | ✅ | 15KB page. Image gallery, variants, nutrition info, allergens, add to cart, freshness badges. 2026-05-10: added mobile sticky add-to-cart bar (IntersectionObserver-driven), bumped tap targets to 44px, added in-stock + dynamic ship-promise strip ("In stock — ships today/tomorrow"), per-unit price now drops the sellByWeight gate (EU compliance for prepackaged grocery). 2026-05-11: sticky bar shifted from bottom-0 to calc(3.5rem + safe-area) so it stacks above MobileBottomNav. 2026-05-12: same-day-ship cutoff (HH:MM) and low-stock display threshold now read from `StorefrontConfig.general` (B22 + B23). 2026-05-12: add-to-cart price now falls back from variant pricing to product `priceRange` when variant pricing is missing. 2026-05-15: product breadcrumb category link now returns to the real `/categories/[slug]` route instead of the stale `/products?zone=` placeholder. 2026-05-24: PDP ProductGallery now renders ordered `media[]`, dedupes thumbnail fallback, and preserves the no-image package placeholder with Playwright coverage. 2026-05-24: PDP purchase panel now groups title/price/availability/pickup/bank-transfer/manual fulfillment/CTA/facts while preserving delivery low-stock shipping copy; food-label sections now render description, ingredients, allergens, nutrition table, storage/origin, and identifiers inline with missing-data collapse. 2026-05-24: PDP now renders same-category related products after label sections, excludes the current product, and skips the rail when category data or alternatives are missing. 2026-05-25: PDP now requests `media.sortOrder` from Zyra and sorts media by it before deduping the thumbnail fallback, with a Playwright regression for unordered backend media. 2026-05-25: fixed narrow mobile horizontal overflow caused by crowded gallery thumbnails forcing grid min-content width, with a 320px Playwright regression. 2026-05-25: mobile purchase controls now use a 320px-safe two-row panel layout, and the sticky bar shows price + add only so Polish CTA copy does not wrap while inline quantity controls remain 44px. |
| Recipes listing (`/recipes`) | ✅ | Recipe grid with cards. |
| Recipe detail (`/recipes/[slug]`) | ✅ | 11KB page. Steps, ingredients with product links, cook time, difficulty. 2026-05-12: add-all-to-cart accepts legacy variant `price`/`currency` when nested variant pricing is absent. |
| Cart (`/cart`) | ✅ | Storage zone grouping, quantity controls, save-for-later (→ wishlist), free shipping progress bar (desktop sidebar + 2026-05-10 mobile sticky bar), mobile sticky summary bar. 2026-05-12: free-shipping threshold now reads from `StorefrontConfig.general` (B21). 2026-05-12: accessibility audit pass for mobile cart; per-line actions now have product-specific accessible names and the hidden BottomNav/sticky checkout CTA contract is covered. 2026-05-12: cart line prices and subtotal fall back to positive product metadata when OMS cart cost returns zero. |
| Checkout (`/checkout`) | ✅ | Multi-step flow: delivery → shipping → payment → review. Saved address selection (auto-advance), promo codes, legacy Zyra checkout handoff, session draft persistence. 2026-05-10: progress bar now sticky-on-mobile (top: var(--header-height), z-30, backdrop-blur), static on desktop. 2026-05-12: accessibility audit pass for mobile checkout; invalid delivery fields focus the first error and connect `aria-describedby`, shipping/payment choices expose `aria-pressed`, inactive accordion panels are `aria-hidden` + inert, and the mobile summary toggle controls its panel. 2026-05-12: order summary now uses the corrected cart subtotal when OMS cart totals are zeroed. 2026-05-13: checkout payment methods now use backend `availablePaymentMethods(channel)` with `id` as `CheckoutPaymentInput.gateway`; promo apply/remove now use legacy checkout promo mutations after checkout creation instead of cart discount mutations. 2026-05-24: `checkoutComplete` `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK` errors now keep the shopper on checkout, show a visible stock banner, and rehydrate cart state. |
| Wishlist (`/wishlist`) | ✅ | Grid cards with images. Move-to-cart action. Remove action. 2026-05-12: accessibility audit pass for BottomNav tab flow; image links are removed from keyboard tab order and add/remove actions have product-specific accessible names. |
| Account (`/account`) | ✅ | Tab-based: Profile, Orders, Addresses. |
| Account → Orders (`/account/orders`) | ✅ | Order list panel. |
| Account → Order detail (`/account/orders/[id]`) | ✅ | Full order detail page (10KB). |
| Login (`/login`) | ✅ | Auth form component with validation. |
| Register (`/register`) | ✅ | Shared `AuthForm.tsx` handles both login and registration. |
| Privacy policy (`/privacy`) | ✅ | Static i18n content. |
| Terms of service (`/terms`) | ✅ | Static i18n content. |

### Components

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Header | ✅ | Sticky, responsive, hide-on-scroll (mobile), search, account dropdown, nav from config. 2026-05-12: added B8 shipping cutoff utility strip above the main nav row so same-day shipping promise is visible without cramping header controls. 2026-05-12: removed mobile-only wishlist/cart shortcuts so the mobile header stays to logo/search/menu while BottomNav owns Home/Wishlist/Cart. 2026-05-14: desktop Categories nav now opens a Kimchi-style mega menu; empty configured `navItems: []` falls back to default nav instead of hiding the header nav. 2026-05-14: mega menu hover path is flush with the header, uses a short close delay, locks background scroll while open, and closes from document-level Escape. 2026-05-23: commercial quick links from `StorefrontConfig.commercial.quickLinks` render after base desktop nav and inside the mobile menu without changing the category mega-menu trigger. 2026-05-23: theme toggle removed from desktop header and mobile menu; stale `grocery-theme` localStorage no longer controls `data-theme`. |
| CategoryMegaMenu | ✅ | 2026-05-14. Desktop-only category mega menu under Header Categories. Lazy-loads Zyra `categories(channel)` on first hover/focus, renders category columns, product counts/Coming soon labels, child category links when present, Browse all CTA, keyboard Escape close, and a visual feature tile from `Category.backgroundImage` when available. 2026-05-14: removed the transparent hover gap under the header and keeps pointer enter/leave ownership shared between the trigger and menu panel. |
| ShippingCountdown | ✅ | 2026-05-12. Header utility-bar widget for B8. Reads `StorefrontConfig.general.sameDayShippingCutoff`, falls back to `12:00`, server-renders static no-JS copy, hydrates into a 1-second HH:MM:SS countdown before cutoff, and switches to "ships tomorrow at HH:MM" at/after cutoff. |
| Footer | ✅ | Links, legal pages, branding. 2026-05-12: added B19 SocialBar consuming admin-configured `general.socialLinks` with accessible external icon links, unknown-platform fallback, duplicate/order preservation, and 44×44 mobile tap targets. |
| MiniCart | ✅ | Desktop hover cart preview with scrollable item list. 2026-05-12: total display uses shared corrected cart subtotal, covering zeroed OMS cart cost payloads. |
| SearchAutocomplete | ✅ | 13KB component. Auto-suggest with keyboard nav. |
| ProductCard | ✅ | 18KB. Desktop card with add-to-cart, wishlist toggle, sale badges, freshness. 2026-05-22: listing quantity stepper now switches to cart-backed quantity after add-to-cart and updates/removes the cart line directly. 2026-05-25: listing mode now surfaces promo state, broad availability, category/origin/storage facts, and pickup/bank-transfer/manual confirmation chips while preserving fast cart and wishlist actions. |
| MobileProductCard | ✅ | 9.6KB. Mobile-optimized variant. 2026-05-22: mobile listing stepper now mirrors the cart line after add-to-cart, including cart badge sync and remove-on-decrement-to-zero behavior. 2026-05-25: listing mode now adds dense scan facts, availability, promo, and pickup/bank-transfer/manual confirmation copy without exposing exact stock. |
| ProductListingClient | ✅ | 2026-05-15. Shared client listing shell for `/products` and `/categories/[slug]`: product query, category-scoped filter construction, sort, desktop filter panel, mobile draft/apply filter sheet, load-more, and responsive initial render for category no-JS coverage. 2026-05-24: all-products listings can now filter by discovered product categories while category pages keep their route-scoped category invariant. 2026-05-24: active committed filters are summarized outside the drawer/panel with removable chips so shoppers can see and recover from narrowed result sets. |
| RecipeCard | ✅ | Recipe card with metadata (time, difficulty, servings). |
| LanguageSwitcher | ✅ | Toggle between EN/PL. |
| ThemeToggle | ✅ | Removed 2026-05-23 by product decision; storefront is light-only and no toggle UI remains. |
| ScrollToTopButton | ✅ | Appears after scroll. 2026-05-25: mobile offset now clears the fixed BottomNav and PDP sticky purchase bar instead of covering bottom purchase chrome. |
| CheckoutProgress | ✅ | Step indicator bar for checkout flow. |
| ConfigProvider | ✅ | Runtime config injection via context + CSS variables. 2026-05-22: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONFIG_API_URL` is now opt-in; when omitted/blank, storefront skips server/client config fetch instead of falling back to localhost. 2026-05-24: optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATIC_CONFIG_URL` can provide a static published config fallback for launch tenants without a production admin config API. |
| MobileBottomNav | ✅ | 2026-05-11. Fixed bottom nav (mobile-only). Active route highlight, hydration-gated count badges, safe-area-inset-bottom for hardware insets. Hidden on `/cart` + `/checkout/*` (own bottom CTAs). PD sticky add-to-cart stacks above. Supersedes the 2026-05-10 MobileFloatingCart pill. 2026-05-13: added Categories tab after B1 category browsing shipped; nav now exposes Home / Categories / Wishlist / Cart. |
| UnitPrice (grocery/) | ✅ | 2026-05-10. Tiny shared component for EU-mandated per-unit price line ("X zł / kg", "X zł / l"). Used on MobileProductCard, ProductCard, and PD page (price block + mobile sticky bar). Drops the prior `sellByWeight &&` gate so prepackaged items render too. Includes UNIT_LABELS mapping (KG → kg, LITER → l, etc.). |
| BlockRenderer | ✅ | Dispatches to block components. |

|---------|--------|-------|
| Dashboard (`/admin`) | ✅ | 2026-05-15: upgraded from a generic overview into a first-publish hub with readiness summary, ordered setup checklist, and next-step CTA backed by centralized publish blockers. Existing summary cards/config links remain below the guidance layer. |

## Cross-Cutting

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Config sync (admin → storefront) | ✅ | Draft/publish flow, 5-min cache TTL on storefront side. 2026-05-22: optional for storefronts like Kamito; omitting `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONFIG_API_URL` disables config fetch and uses built-in fallbacks. 2026-05-23: `commercial` config defaults are normalized on admin read and storefront server/client config fetches so older stored configs do not crash new code. 2026-05-23: restored Kamito homepage banner blocks after the main merge introduced a tracked Kamito config with empty `homepage.blocks`. |
| Type sync (`StorefrontConfig`) | ✅ | Defined in both apps — must be kept in sync manually. 2026-05-23: added synced `CommercialConfig`, `CommercialQuickLink`, `CommercialCollection`, and outlet config types. 2026-05-23: removed `layout.header.showThemeToggle` from both type definitions. |
| Zyra checkout backend contract tests | ✅ | 2026-05-13: added `npm run test:checkout-contract` to lock payment-method and legacy checkout promo GraphQL contracts from the backend bot session. |
| E2E tests (Playwright) | 🔧 | Test infrastructure set up, mock-route pattern established. Coverage unknown — need audit. 2026-05-11: added spec-first testing rule after finding implementation-shaped assertions in mobile product layout tests. 2026-05-12: added true RED→GREEN spec-first B19 SocialBar coverage (12 runs green). 2026-05-12: added true RED→GREEN B8 shipping countdown coverage (16 runs green). 2026-05-12: repaired stale mobile homepage spec by replacing the blocked quick-categories assertion with shipped Shop-by-Zone behavior and deterministic config mocking. 2026-05-12: added deterministic SSR config mock server for Playwright, RED→GREEN SEO/tracking coverage, repaired PD sticky tests that assumed every mobile viewport could force the sticky state, and added homepage + Wishlist + Cart + Checkout accessibility coverage; full suite now 148/148 green. 2026-05-12: added RED→GREEN cart price-integrity coverage for zeroed OMS cart cost payloads across header, cart, and checkout. 2026-05-13: added B1 category browsing + BottomNav category coverage; targeted Pixel run printed 15/15 `ok`, but the Playwright process hung during teardown and timed out (tracked as harness debt). 2026-05-14: added no-JS SSR category coverage and targeted Pixel category + BottomNav runs returned cleanly. 2026-05-14: added RED→GREEN desktop category mega-menu coverage for hover, keyboard focus, visual tile, counts, coming-soon state, and category navigation. 2026-05-14: added regressions for header-attached mega-menu geometry and body scroll lock while the desktop menu is open. 2026-05-15: added RED→GREEN category listing filter coverage for desktop category-scoped `products` queries and mobile draft/apply category filters; targeted Pixel category and products-listing regressions passed. 2026-05-22: added RED→GREEN mobile homepage regression proving admin-configured hero block copy and CTA render in the first viewport. 2026-05-22: added RED→GREEN listing cart-controls regression for desktop/mobile product cards and hardened mini-cart price test to open via focus instead of touch-emulated hover. 2026-05-23: added RED→GREEN commercial navigation coverage for desktop quick links, mobile quick links, configured collection route, honest outlet route, 404 behavior, and category mega-menu preservation. 2026-05-24: added RED→GREEN `/products` category-filter coverage for desktop immediate filtering and mobile draft/apply semantics. 2026-05-24: added RED→GREEN active-filter summary and empty-result recovery coverage for desktop and mobile products listing. 2026-05-25: added RED→GREEN product card scan-value coverage for desktop and mobile listing cards, including price/unit price, promo, availability-only stock, category/origin/storage, pickup, bank transfer, manual confirmation, and preserved purchase controls. 2026-05-25: added RED→GREEN PDP gallery coverage that requires the detail query to request `media.sortOrder` and renders unordered backend media in display order before the thumbnail fallback. 2026-05-25: added RED→GREEN 320px PDP gallery overflow coverage for crowded thumbnail rows. 2026-05-25: added RED→GREEN regressions for 320px Polish PDP purchase controls and scroll-to-top/BottomNav overlap. |
| Error handling | ✅ | Consistent toast + banner pattern across checkout and forms. |
| Accessibility | 🔧 | ARIA labels on interactive elements, focus-visible ring, sr-only utility, landmark roles. 2026-05-10 mobile tap targets bumped to 44x44 (WCAG 2.5.5 AAA) on `MobileProductCard` + PD wishlist/add buttons. 2026-05-12: started page-by-page audit with homepage keyboard skip control to `main#main-content`, then audited Wishlist, Cart, and Checkout flows; saved/cart item actions now use product-specific accessible names, mobile cart checkout remains reachable without BottomNav, and checkout validation/choice/summary accordion states are covered by Playwright. Full audit still pending. |
| SEO meta tags | ✅ | Admin SEO config page exists. 2026-05-12: storefront `generateMetadata()` now reads published config for title, description, canonical, OG image, and favicon; covered by Playwright RED→GREEN spec. |
| Tracking scripts | ✅ | Admin tracking config exists. `TrackingScripts.tsx` component exists (3KB). 2026-05-12: Playwright verifies enabled Facebook Pixel, GA4, and GTM scripts inject after config refresh while disabled Hotjar stays absent. |

## Known Issues & Debt

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 5 admin block editors are stubs | Low | `CircularGridEditor`, `GradientPicker`, `ImageSizeHint`, `LongBannerEditor`, `SliderBlockEditor` — all 45-byte placeholder files. |
| Checkout page is 1492 lines | Low | Functional but large. Could be split if more features are added. |
| Some E2E tests are implementation-shaped | Medium | Several mobile tests still assert exact DOM/CSS geometry (`getComputedStyle`, `boundingBox`, pixel thresholds) without an explicit PRD/spec anchor. 2026-05-12: repaired PD sticky tests to use the accessibility contract (`aria-hidden`) and an explicit short viewport for the out-of-view scenario, but broader audit remains. |
| Runtime-configured images still use raw `<img>` | Medium | 2026-05-25: scoped lint disables keep `npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0` clean on admin/runtime media surfaces (logo, banner blocks, PromoBanner, commercial blocks). Do not blindly convert to `next/image` until production admin/CDN image domains or a safe unoptimized loader policy are decided. |
| Playwright command hangs after successful targeted runs on Windows | Medium | 2026-05-13: targeted category/BottomNav run printed 15/15 `ok`, but `playwright.cmd` did not return before the shell timeout. No `:3018` or `:4199` listener remained afterward. Treat as harness teardown debt; do not use the timeout alone as product failure without checking per-test output/artifacts. |
| Admin panel lacks dedicated browser-level test coverage | Medium | 2026-05-15: first admin UX slice added focused unit coverage for publish-readiness logic, but admin pages still do not have their own Playwright/component test harness. Manual browser verification remains required for UI regressions until that layer exists. |
| Live `chesaigon` catalog regressed to 1 visible product | High | 2026-05-15: fresh GraphQL probe returned `totalCount: 1` for `products(channel:"chesaigon")`, contradicting the 2026-05-13 snapshot of 121 storefront-visible products. Product-data-dependent UI validation is unreliable until backend restores representative channel data or confirms a replacement source. |
| Kenmito production content still lacks owner assets/contact details | Medium | 2026-06-06: display branding and canonical URL are set, but phone, email, address, prepared logo/favicon/hero imagery, pickup/bank-transfer instructions, and legal/contact routing still need owner-approved production data. The existing 320x320 KENMITO JPG has excessive whitespace and is not wired as a production header logo. |
| Kamito tenant release audit intentionally fails until owner data exists | Medium | 2026-06-06: `npm run audit:kamito-config` now has the canonical URL and clean promotional config; it should continue to fail only for missing owner phone, email, and address until real values are supplied. |
| Kamito checkout backend methods are not wired in production | High | 2026-06-06 backend audit: `availablePaymentMethods(channel:"kamito")=[]` and `availableShippingMethods(channel:"kamito")=[]`, so checkout cannot complete. Frontend must not fake `bank_transfer` or `PICKUP`; backend must link/create the channel methods and prove guest/auth test orders. |
| Kamito backend ops notifications are not wired | High | 2026-05-24: backend confirmed `ORDER_CREATED` webhook/subscription is not configured and checkout completion emits no event. Storefront must not promise automated email/SMS; launch needs backend webhook/event wiring or manual ops order monitoring. |
| Kamito product media contains duplicate CDN assets | Medium | 2026-05-25: live CDN bytes confirm duplicate image files under different URLs on multi-image products, e.g. `KIMCHI-5216` sort orders 2/4 and 3/5 are exact SHA-256 matches, and `KIMCHI-5215` sort orders 2/4 match. Frontend URL de-dupe cannot catch this because URLs differ; backend importer/data cleanup needs to remove duplicate assets. |
